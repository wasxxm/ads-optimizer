# OptiGuide Ad Placement Optimizer

## Overview

OptiGuide Ad Placement Optimizer is a Python-based project designed to optimize ad placement using dynamic programming techniques. This project includes a chatbot capable of writing Python code to answer users' questions about ad placement optimization and explain solutions from a dynamic programming perspective.

## Features

- Dynamic ad placement optimization using Python
- Chatbot integration for interactive code writing and explanations
- Safe execution of provided code snippets

## Project Structure

- `optiguide.py`: Main script containing the OptiGuideAgent class and system messages for the ad placement optimizer.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- Additional scripts and configurations as needed for ad placement optimization.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Required Python libraries: 
  - `openai`
  - `langchain`
  - `pandas`
  - `dotenv`
  - `googlemaps`
  - `concurrent.futures`
  - `asyncio`
  - `time`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/wasxxm/ads-optimizer.git
    cd ads-optimizer
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
    - Add your OpenAI API key and any other necessary configurations:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the OptiGuide Agent**:
    ```sh
    python optiguide.py
    ```

2. **Interact with the chatbot**:
    - The chatbot can write Python code snippets to answer questions related to ad placement optimization.
    - Example questions and answers are included in the `optiguide.py` script.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the chatbot for ad placement optimization:

```python
# Example question:
question = "How can I optimize ad placement for maximum revenue?"

# Get the response from the chatbot:
response = OptiGuideAgent.get_response(question)
print(response)
```
